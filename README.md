# A Collection of Data projects
This is a collection of various data projects I've worked on using python.

## Meteorite
Meteorite is the first project based on a data set which tracks the size a location, and date of meteorite impacts.

## Bundesliga
Bundesliga is an exploration of red cards on the outcome of soccer games.
